# Virtual Private Network 

This repository contains the project files developed during my internship at CodeClause. The primary focus of this project is to create a Virtual Private Network (VPN) using Java. A VPN offers a secure and private network for users to access resources over the internet, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: This project aims to develop a Java-based VPN solution that provides a secure and encrypted connection for users to access resources over public networks.

- **Internship Period**: The work on this project was conducted during my internship at CodeClause. It represents the culmination of the skills and knowledge acquired during this period.

## Features

- **Secure Data Transmission**: The VPN ensures data transmitted between the user and the target resource is secure and encrypted.

- **Data Confidentiality**: Users can send and receive data without the risk of eavesdropping or unauthorized access.

- **User Authentication**: The VPN may include user authentication methods to ensure only authorized users can access the network.

- **Server Infrastructure**: The project may involve setting up VPN servers to handle client connections and data routing.

- **Documentation**: Proper documentation, including code comments and user guides, should be provided for understanding and using the VPN.

## Usage

To utilize this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. **Set Up the VPN Servers**: If server infrastructure is required, set up the VPN servers following the provided documentation.

3. **Build and Run the VPN Client**: Build and run the Java VPN client application to establish a secure connection.

4. **Authentication**: If the VPN requires authentication, enter your credentials as specified in the user guide.

5. **Secure Connection**: Once connected, your data is transmitted securely over the VPN.

6. **Access Resources**: You can now access resources as if you were on a private network.
